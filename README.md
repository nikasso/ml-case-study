# Churn Prediction

This was a one-day case-study to address the problem of churn-prediction with an anonymous ride-sharing company. The company was interested in predicting rider retention. The task was to understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help the company. Therefore, the goal was not only to build a model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows for interpretability of the factors that contributed to the predictions.
